<b> Problem Statement: </b>

Over a great period, many issues have been faced by students to manage their time and work productively. One of the challenges they face every day is to remember things.
Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

This project proposes a “Todo App” to keep track of all the tasks we need to do and helps us stay productive. Its features include login / signup, add todo tasks, automatic deletion once completed, etc. It accepts data allowing them to register to the application. This application stores todo list data and map it to the database. Currently the app works for all the android phones. The project's scope is to extend it's functionality and usage.

<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

- The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the user add their todo tasks. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app : 
- Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText and interactive buttons made it easier for people to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
- RecyclerView : To present the list of todos we used the efficient recyclerview.
- LiveData & Room Database : We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the todo completion if there is any change then we take it to local databases using Room.

<b> Application Link & Future Scope : </b>

The app is currently in the testing phase with GDSC MRIIRS with a limited no. of users, You can access the app : <a href="https://github.com/pranav2012/Android-Study-Jams/raw/master/app/release/app-release.apk">here</a>

Once the app is fully tested and functional in GDSC MRIIRS, we plan to talk to neighboring colleges family members friends to propose this app idea and help them be productive. We aim that by next year most of our friends and college mates will start using todo to schedule their day and be productive. Also we are planning to generate email alerts and set time durations to complete the todo.
